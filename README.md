# AI Science Shorts Studio üé¨ü§ñ

**HackOdisha 5.0 Project | Team: [Your Team Name]**

## üéØ Project Overview

AI Science Shorts Studio is an automated video generation platform that creates engaging 30-60 second vertical videos from scripts using AI-powered workflows. Built with **Orkes Conductor** for workflow orchestration and **Akash Network** for decentralized GPU compute.

## üöÄ What It Does

**One-Click Video Generation:**
- Input: Text script or topic
- Output: Professional vertical video with AI-generated visuals, voiceover, and captions
- Perfect for: Educational content, social media, science communication

**Two Generation Modes:**
1. **Script Provided**: User provides script ‚Üí Generate visuals + audio
2. **AI-Written Script**: Topic input ‚Üí AI writes script ‚Üí Generate complete video

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### **The Cast (Who Does What)**

* **Next.js Frontend (UI):** Single-page interface to start runs and watch live status. Never talks to Akash or Orkes directly‚Äîonly to your backend.
* **FastAPI Backend (Control Plane):** Single public API that orchestrates everything. Starts runs, manages Orkes workflows, calls Akash GPU services, handles Cloudflare R2 artifacts, and streams live updates to frontend.
* **Orkes Conductor (The Brain):** Workflow engine that executes step-by-step pipeline (facts ‚Üí script ‚Üí storyboard ‚Üí media generation ‚Üí TTS ‚Üí assembly ‚Üí finish). Handles retries, timeouts, and optional human-in-the-loop.
* **Akash Network (The Muscle):** Decentralized GPU infrastructure hosting model services:
  * `t2i` (text-to-image, FLUX/SDXL)
  * `i2v` (image-to-video, AnimateDiff/SVD)
  * `ffmpeg` (video assembly, overlays, audio mixing)
* **Cloudflare R2 (Artifacts):** S3-compatible storage for all media assets. Everything private with pre-signed URLs.
* **External APIs:** LLM for script generation, TTS for voiceover (with self-hosted fallback).

### **How They Connect (HTTP Only)**

* **Frontend ‚Üí Backend:** HTTPS requests only. Browser never touches Akash, Orkes, or R2 directly.
* **Backend ‚Üí Orkes:** Starts workflows via API. Orkes calls back to backend task endpoints.
* **Backend ‚Üî Akash:** Backend calls warm GPU endpoints with pre-signed R2 URLs for media I/O.
* **Backend ‚Üî R2:** Generates short-lived upload/download URLs for all artifacts.
* **Backend ‚Üî APIs:** Direct calls to LLM/TTS with server-side keys.

### **Complete Video Generation Flow**

1. **User clicks Generate** ‚Üí Frontend sends options to backend ‚Üí Backend creates `run_id`, starts Orkes workflow, returns immediately
2. **Frontend navigates to /run/{id}** ‚Üí Subscribes to server-sent events for live updates
3. **Orkes executes pipeline** by calling backend endpoints:
   * **CollectFacts:** Gather trending topics, write facts.json to R2
   * **WriteScript:** LLM generates ‚â§120 word script, store script.json
   * **StoryboardPlan:** Create shots.json (prompts, timing, motion selection)
   * **GenerateMedia:** Parallel generation of 5 stills + 1-2 animated clips via Akash
   * **TextToSpeech:** Generate narration.wav with timing map
   * **GenerateCaptions:** Build captions.srt aligned to audio
   * **AssembleSegments:** Akash ffmpeg combines all assets into final.mp4
   * **NotifyComplete:** Emit final event with cost breakdown
4. **Frontend shows progress** ‚Üí Live step updates, final video player, cost estimate
